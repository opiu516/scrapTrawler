# scrapTrawler 

A super basic browser game that shows the power of javaScript in game creating. It is made without using a framework or game engine. In the game you are the pink bot that has to
go out and collect scrap using it's drill. But beware there are enemies lurking on the field with scrap. Whenever you mine scrap, you either get health or scrapPoints. 
you can use scrapPoints to upgrade your robot at the vendors in the safeZone (the blue button opens and closes the laser wall which damages enemies), you buy upgrades by bumping 
in the scrapVendors and having enoug scrapPoints. Now the question how do you deal with enemies, you can plant mines by paying scrap 3 scrapPoints = 1 mine it deals nearly lethal 
damage to enemies so yo can easly finish them using your drill.
controls: 
  arrows - movement
  "X" - get out drill
  "Z" - plant mine
